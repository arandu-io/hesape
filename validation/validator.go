// Package validation checks a submitted form against a set of rules.
//
// The surface is Laravel's, string rules included, so that somebody arriving
// from it recognises the whole thing without reading anything:
//
//	var Register = validation.MustCompile(validation.Rules{
//		"name":     "required|max:255",
//		"email":    "required|email",
//		"password": "required|min:12|confirmed",
//	})
//
//	in, err := ctx.Validate(requests.Register)
//	if err != nil {
//		return err
//	}
//
// A rule set is compiled ONCE, in a package-level variable, and every rule
// string is parsed and checked there: an unknown rule, a missing or unparseable
// argument, a pattern that does not compile, a cross-field reference naming a
// field that does not exist -- each of those fails at boot, naming the field,
// the rule and the file, and all of them are reported together. A rule set that
// boots is a rule set whose names are all real.
//
// Sixty-one of Laravel's rules ship. Every one of the others is named in
// refused.go with the reason it is not here and where the answer lives instead,
// so a rule copied from a Laravel application gets an argument rather than
// "unknown rule". Two of those reasons are worth knowing before writing
// anything: `unique` and `exists` reach a repository and a rule set carries no
// security.Grant (RULE 17), and `date_format` takes a Go layout
// (date_format:2006-01-02), never a PHP one.
//
// There is no reflection and there are no struct tags. The rule set is data,
// the request struct is written by hand or generated, and the values that
// passed are read out of Input one at a time -- so a field nobody declared a
// rule for cannot reach a repository through here.
//
// This is the package Illuminate\Validation answers to. The rule table in
// rules.go is Concerns\ValidatesAttributes and Rules\*, the boot check in
// compile.go is ValidationRuleParser, and the sentence a failure carries is
// Concerns\FormatsMessages. Illuminate\Validation\Concerns and
// Illuminate\Validation\Rules do not become packages of their own: a rule here
// is one entry in one table, and splitting the arity, the check and the message
// across three files is how a rule ends up accepting an argument nobody
// validates. The pieces of the component that are not here are decisions rather
// than gaps -- Factory, ValidationServiceProvider and the DatabasePresence
// verifiers all assume a container and a repository reachable without a Grant,
// which RULES 2 and 17 refuse, and NestedRules and ConditionalRules assume a
// nested input, which a submitted form is not.
