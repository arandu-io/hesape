// Pattern is a mask written in tokens.
//
// The tokens are the ones the ecosystem this borrows its vocabulary from uses,
// so somebody who has written a mask before writes the same string here:
//
//	0  a digit, required
//	9  a digit, optional
//	#  a digit, repeated to the end of the value
//	A  a letter or a digit
//	S  a letter
//
// Every other character is written through as it stands. A pattern that needs a
// literal token character is not expressible, and that is the price of the
// vocabulary being the familiar one; a mask of literal hashes is not a thing
// anybody has asked for.
