//
// The gap it has to cover is one redirect, which is milliseconds. Five minutes
// is slack for a browser that was closed mid-navigation and reopened, and short
// enough that a message cannot resurface on a page nobody submitted -- which is
// the failure that makes flashed state untrustworthy. The cookie is cleared on
// the read anyway; this is what covers the read that never happens.

//
// A browser drops a cookie over about 4096 bytes SILENTLY -- no error, no
// warning, nothing in the log. Past that limit the flash is discarded by the
// browser and the screen says nothing again, which is the bug this whole path
// exists to fix, arrived at by a different route. So the budget is enforced
// here, where something can be done about it: see Flash.Write for what is given
// up first.

// the browser throws away: one field carrying one message of at most this length
// always fits in MaxFlashBytes.

// The two halves of the payload. A single url.Values carries both, with the key

// a form as if it were current.
