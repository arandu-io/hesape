//
// It is the assertion a listing needs and nothing else provides. The number
// exists in two other places and neither is one: the Collector counts a whole
// request, which is the wrong unit for a repository method, and the connection's
// query log is a list somebody has to turn on, read and turn off again around
// the code under test.
//
// What it catches is the loop that queries: a list of twenty rows that asks the
// database twenty-one times still returns the right page, so no assertion about
// the page can fail. The count is the only thing that changes.
//
// # It counts a block rather than being a counter
//
// A listener registered on a connection cannot be taken off it again, so a
// counter with a start and a stop would leave one behind for every test that
// used it. Bracketing a block is the shape that fits: the listener that stays
// behind stops counting when the block returns, including when the block panics,
// and a later assertion registers its own.
//
// Everything the connection ran is counted, including a statement another
// goroutine issued while the block was running. That is the honest scope of a
// connection-wide listener, and it is also the right one -- a query the code
// under test spawned is a query it made.
//
// The statements are printed on failure. "ran 21, want 2" without them is a
// number, and the answer to which twenty-one is in the list.
