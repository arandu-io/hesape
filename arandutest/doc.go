// Package arandutest holds the helpers a test needs and an application must
// not use.
//
// It is a browser (Client), the assertions worth having about what came back
// (Response), the assertions worth having about what landed in the database
// (AssertDatabaseHas, AssertDatabaseMissing, AssertDatabaseCount,
// AssertSoftDeleted, AssertNotSoftDeleted), the assertion about how many
// statements a block ran (AssertQueryCount), and the two pieces a test needs to
// say something about domain events (DrainOutbox, Collected).
//
// Every application writes the same six things: send a request, do not follow
// the redirect, keep the cookie, act as somebody, assert about the HTML that
// came back, assert about the row that was written.
//
// # Nothing here is a second implementation
//
// Everything drives the same code path production drives. There is no
// synchronous mode, no in-memory substitute and no test double for the outbox:
// "sync only in tests" is a second way to do one thing, and the second way
// always leaks into production -- usually on the day somebody copies a test
// into a handler.
//
// The same rule is why acting as somebody is Client.ActingAs and nothing else.
// The subject travels under auth.WithSubject, which is the key the edge
// middleware writes and every policy reads. A package-level ActingAs used to
// live here writing a context key of its own, which no policy, no repository
// and no middleware ever read: it authenticated nothing, and a test written
// against it passed while proving the opposite of what it said. Code that calls
// a service, a job or a seeder directly does not need this package for it --
// auth.WithSubject is the whole answer, and it is the real one.
//
// # The database assertions read without a Grant, on purpose
//
// These five do, and that is what they are for: they check what the
// Grant-protected path actually wrote, so they cannot be the same path or they
// would prove nothing. They take a table name and a match, never an entity,
// and they never appear outside a _test.go.
//
// Because they read the table and not the tenant's slice of it, a match that
// omits the tenant column proves the row exists somewhere. In a multi-tenant
// application that is rarely the assertion anybody means: put the tenant in the
// match.
//
// # The name
//
// It is spelled arandutest rather than testing because an import segment
// called "testing" shadows the standard library package that every _test.go
// imports; the precedent is net/http/httptest.
//
// # What it deliberately does not carry
//
// There is no assertion language over JSON here: what these handlers answer
// with is HTML fragments, and [Response.AssertSee] over the fragment is the
// assertion that matches. There is no per-process schema cloning, no console
// command runner and no view-level assertion.
