// -- the error page and the console -- and a second copy is a second place to
// add the next editor. The editor name comes from the log configuration.
//
// The scheme has to reach the template as template.URL: html/template rewrites
// an unknown scheme to #ZgotmplZ, which turns every link on the page into a dead
// one and gives no hint why.
